# GenerateBridge

GenerateBridge is a WHM API Bridge designed to enable the integration of WHM client areas with non-WHM APIs, facilitating the seamless interaction between cPanel and other external systems.

## Features

GenerateBridge offers several features to enhance the functionality and integration capabilities of cPanel with non-WHM APIs:

### 1. `createacct` ✅
   - This feature allows you to create accounts within cPanel through non-WHM APIs, streamlining the process of provisioning new hosting accounts.

### 2. `removeacct` ❌
   - While not yet fully implemented, the `removeacct` feature aims to provide the ability to remove cPanel accounts using non-WHM APIs. This feature is currently under development.

### 3. MOFH Support (unfinished)
   - GenerateBridge is actively working on adding support for MOFH (MyOwnFreeHost) through non-WHM APIs. This feature is currently a work in progress, with the goal of enabling smooth integration with MOFH hosting services.

### 4. ResellersPanel Support (unfinished)
   - Similar to MOFH support, GenerateBridge is also in the process of integrating with ResellersPanel through non-WHM APIs. This feature is under development to enhance compatibility with ResellersPanel hosting services.

### 5. `detect_cpanel_bridge` ✅

GenerateBridge aims to bridge the gap between cPanel and non-WHM APIs, offering a range of features to simplify and enhance the integration process. Whether you need to create accounts, detect the cPanel Bridge, or integrate with specific hosting providers like MOFH or ResellersPanel, GenerateBridge is designed to facilitate these connections.
